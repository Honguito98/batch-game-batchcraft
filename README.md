This game is mostly a paint-like program, so you actually control the game using the mouse.
If you are running in Win 8-11 etc., make sure CMD Console is running in Legacy Mode, with 'Quick Edit Mode' disabled.

These options are available by right-clicking on the top left of window, and select 'Properties'.
If does not work, then try to open a new cmd instance (run cmd.exe) and select 'Defaults'.
